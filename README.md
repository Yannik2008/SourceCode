Hi, I´m Wenkain. 
This is my work as a student and Network-enthusiast.

I´m focusing on well build and easy to understand programms which serve multiple purposes.

The topics might vary because of my changing interests and ongoing education. 

I try to work on these projects for some amount of time and maybe some of them get their chance and get out of the development phase.

I´m relativ new to programming and try to focus on Python and Java.

I´m trying to explore the most fascinating parts of programming with my current skill level. Thi smay result in simple programms or games.

I hope I can inspire you to get to work and build something your own.

Kind regards,

Wenkain
