Hi, I´m Wenkain. 
This is my work as a student and Network-enthusiast.

I´m focusing on well build and easy to understand programms which serve multiple purposes.

The topics might vary because of my changing interests and ongoing education. 

I try to work on these projects for some amount of time and maybe some of them get their chance and get out of the development phase.

Programming is kind of new to me and therefor I will try to focus on Python and Java.

My mission is set to explore the most fascinating parts of programming with my current skill level. This may result in simple programms or games.

I hope I can inspire you to get to work and build something your own.

Kind regards,

Wenkain
